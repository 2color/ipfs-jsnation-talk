## js-IPFS History

* Started as a go-ipfs clone
* Aiming for feature parity
  * Not a good fit!
  * Not streamlined for use-cases
  * Kitchen-sink style implementation

## Where are we now?

* Evolved to be an ecosystem of modules
* Library-first approach
  * ipfs-core
  * unixfs
  * bitswap
  * libp2p
* Pick & choose components
