# Why: The Web Platform and User Agency

- The Web Platform has the widest reach globally
  - The ability of a user to make meaningful **choices** and take intentional **actions** within a system.
- The evolution of Web and its APIs has expanded those capabilities over time. Examples:
  - HTTPS/TLS: privacy
  - PWAs: native like, offline.
  - WebRTC: real time communication
- The web is location addressed
  - Link rot
  - No guarantee of **integrity**
  - Single points of failure
- Location addressing relies on trust for security
  - When you go
  - The Same-origin policy delineates the trust & security boundaries on the web: **protocol,port,host.**
  - Certificate authorities verify ownership of domain/origin to grant TLS certificates.
- What if the web took a different approach: content addressing?
