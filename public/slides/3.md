# 😧 Pain points

> What does js-ipfs not do well?

## 🖥️ CPU intensive tasks?

* JavaScript is slow, right?
* Not exactly, we can use WASM or C++ for this
  * (not a magic bullet, comes with significant DX caveats)

## ☁️ Network intensive tasks?

* Browsers have significant limitations
  * Connectivity
    * Limited number of connections
    * Cannot open TCP sockets (probably a good thing?!)
* Node.js OTOH is *very* good at this

## 🧑‍🚀 Native future-tech Web stuff

* No quic implementation in Node.js (yet, sort of)
  * An unmerged PR that uses a fork of OpenSSL 😱
* Web Crypto missing some essential algorithms
  * Ed25519 keys
  * Async everywhere - whyyyyyy
